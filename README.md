## *Title:* Unlocking Student Loan Insights: A Data-Driven Approach to Risk Management and Investment Patterns

*Introduction:*
As a data analyst, I'm excited to share my findings from a recent project with Future Clan Enterprises, a leading financial institution. Our goal was to segment student loan borrowers and analyze investment patterns to inform risk management strategies and investment decisions.

## *Tools used*


*Key Findings:*

- *Gender:* Male borrowers dominate the loan market, accounting for the majority of loans.
